# React patterns for KotlinJs

This is a showcase of React patterns and other associate libraries as used in KotlinJS via [Jetbrain's Kotlin Wrappers](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers).

This is a work in progress that I'm using in my journey to learn KotlinJS. If you find anything that is wrong, can have some undesirable side effecto or, simply, can be improved, pelase submit an [issue](https://github.com/jfontsaballs/KotlinJsReactPatterns/issues/new).
